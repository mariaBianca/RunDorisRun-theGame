##About the game

###Game story and objectives:

```
Doris is a 26 years old female potato and a lover of nature. Perhaps it was the fact that
she was born and raised in an urban city that brought on her love of it. She was always
surrounded by big building and fast moving cars, and she was never fond of it. For as long as
she could remember, she’d loved camping and exploring the woods. Once Doris hit the age
of adulthood, she packed her bags and moved to a rural area where she made the forest her
home. Doris’ love of nature is what saved her life.
When the economical crisis hit the world, she was well hidden in the woods to be affected by
the lack of food, and provision in the city. Then the Dark Potato Lord took advantage of its
fellow potatoes’ suffering and took over the world. He established a regime built on fear, and
kills everybody who opposes him and his evil rulement.
At first she thought that she could build a life under the ruling of the Dark Potato Lord in the
city, but soon did she realised that going around with those evil fellows will destroy her
appreciation and love for life. Then she ran back to the countryside, where she spends her
time protecting her home, and the tiny innocent left potatoes from the armies of the evil
tyrant. She is known for always wearing a headscarf, for her true identity never to be revealed
to the evil mutatoes. Will Doris be able to protect her fellow innocent potatoes? Will she be
able to defeat the armies of the evil Potato Lord? Play and see!
